# enemybars - WoW 1.12 addOn 

enemybars alerts you of nearby enemies which it tries to detect in various ways. The alert consists of a sound effect as well as a bar with portrait, class, level and health information. A target scan is used to collect this information, but only when it will not interfere with the game in any way (e.g., no active combo points). Information for target and mouseover is updated continuously, for other bars it is only done every 30 seconds for performance reasons.
